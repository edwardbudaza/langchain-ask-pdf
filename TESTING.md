# TestPDFTextExtraction and TestMainFunction: Testing the Functionality of PDF Text Extraction and Main Application

## Introduction
This markdown file discusses the importance of testing the functionality of PDF text extraction and the main application in the context of the project "ASK YOUR PDF." The tests, TestPDFTextExtraction and TestMainFunction, focus on verifying the correctness and proper functioning of key components within the application.

## TestPDFTextExtraction
The TestPDFTextExtraction class is responsible for testing the `extract_text_from_pdf` function, which extracts text from a PDF file. This test is crucial to ensure that the extraction process works as expected and that the extracted text matches the desired output.

### Importance of the Test
The extraction of text from PDF files is a fundamental step in the application, as it forms the basis for subsequent operations such as text splitting, embedding creation, and question-answering. By thoroughly testing the `extract_text_from_pdf` function, we can validate the accuracy and reliability of the extracted text, ensuring that the subsequent steps in the application are based on correct data.

### Test Details
The TestPDFTextExtraction class contains the following test case:

- `test_extract_text_from_pdf`: This test case mocks the PdfReader and its pages to simulate PDF content. It then calls the `extract_text_from_pdf` function and compares the extracted text with the expected result. If the extracted text matches the expected output, the test passes.

## TestMainFunction
The TestMainFunction class focuses on testing the main functionality of the application, including the integration of various components and user interactions. It simulates user input, such as uploading a PDF file and providing a question about the PDF, to ensure that the application behaves correctly.

### Importance of the Test
The TestMainFunction test plays a vital role in ensuring that the application functions smoothly and provides the intended user experience. By testing the main function, we can detect potential issues or errors in the integration of components, user input handling, and overall application flow. This helps in delivering a reliable and user-friendly application.

### Test Details
The TestMainFunction class contains the following test case:

- `test_main_with_pdf_file`: This test case mocks the necessary objects and functions required for the main function. It simulates user interactions by providing a fake PDF file and a fake user question. The test verifies the expected behavior of the application, including the correct loading of environment variables, page configuration, header display, file uploading, text input, and function calls. Assertions are used to verify that the expected functions are called with the correct arguments, ensuring the proper execution of the application.

## Running the Tests
To run the tests, execute the following command in the terminal:

``` python test_app.py ```

This command will run the Python script test_app.py and execute all the test cases defined within the TestPDFTextExtraction and TestMainFunction classes. If all the tests pass without any errors, you can have confidence in the correctness and reliability of the PDF text extraction and main application functionalities.
